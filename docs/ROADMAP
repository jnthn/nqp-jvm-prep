NQP JVM Preparation Roadmap

This provides an idea of the things that need to be worked on. By now, the
cross-compiler can cross-compile NQP itself to the JVM. This produces an NQP
that does not need Parrot to run. There are still some NQP tests that are not
passing; this simply means they're not required to compile NQP itself, but no
doubt the things they test will be needed for Rakudo on NQP.
