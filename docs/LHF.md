# Low Hanging Fruit
Some (comparatively :-)) easy tasks for those who want to get involved.

## Missing positional ops
Implement and test deletepos. These need new static method adding
to Ops. add an op for deletepos, which could be done in terms of splice.

## Port xor
The code-gen for QAST::Op type xor needs porting. Potentially a bit fiddly, but
should be mostly transliteration.
